        molecular biologists, and computational chemists focusing on the study
        of STAT5 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5) proteins.
        This package offers a robust set of tools to interface with the Protein
        Data Bank (PDB), enabling users to efficiently retrieve, analyze, and
        visualize STAT5 structures and their interactions. The package is
        particularly adept at exploring protein-ligand interactions,
        understanding STAT5â€™s role in various signaling pathways, and examining
        its interactions with other proteins and potential inhibitors.
        Furthermore this package can be used to help people to find suitable
